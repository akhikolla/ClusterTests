Description: Contains posterior samplers for the Bayesian piecewise linear log-hazard and piecewise exponential hazard models, including Cox models. Posterior mean restricted survival times are also computed for non-Cox an Cox models with only treatment indicators. The ApproxMean() function can be used to estimate restricted posterior mean survival times given a vector of patient covariates in the Cox model. Functions included to return the posterior mean hazard and survival functions for the piecewise exponential and piecewise linear log-hazard models. Chapple, AG, Peak, T, Hemal, A (2020).
