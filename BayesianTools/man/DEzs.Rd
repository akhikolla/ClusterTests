\details{
For parallel computing, the likelihood density in the bayesianSetup needs to be parallelized, i.e. needs to be able to operate on a matrix of proposals

For blockUpdate the first element in the list determines the type of blocking.
Possible choices are
\itemize{
 \item{"none"}{ (default), no blocking of parameters}
 \item{"correlation"} { blocking based on correlation of parameters. Using h or k (see below)}
 \item{"random"} { random blocking. Using k (see below)}
 \item{"user"} { user defined groups. Using groups (see below)}
 }
 Further seven parameters can be specified. "k" determnined the number of groups, "h" the strength
 of the correlation used to group parameter and "groups" is used for user defined groups.
 "groups" is a vector containing the group number for each parameter. E.g. for three parameters 
 with the first two in one group, "groups" would be c(1,1,2).
 Further pSel and pGroup can be used to influence the choice of groups. In the sampling process
 a number of groups is randomly drawn and updated. pSel is a vector containing relative probabilities
 for an update of the respective number of groups. E.g. for always updating only one group pSel = 1.
 For updating one or two groups with the same probability pSel = c(1,1). By default all numbers
 have the same probability.
 The same principle is used in pGroup. Here the user can influence the probability of each group
 to be updated. By default all groups have the same probability.
 Finally "groupStart" defines the starting point of the groupUpdate and "groupIntervall" the intervall
 in which the groups are evaluated.
