# BayesianTools 0.1.4

Compatibility

- added NIMBLE support to getSample and plotting functions
- added coda support to plotTimeSeriesResults and plotMarginals

Changes

- IMPORTANT: added a warning when calling runMCMC with the "twalk" sampler. At the moment, using this sampler is discouraged
- marginalPlot can now plot prior and/or posterior, either as histogram or as violin plots
- added bridge sampling to marginalLikelihood
- added shortcuts for AM, DR and DRAM samplers

Bugfixes:

- when calling getSample on mcmcSamplerList, the chains are now merged instead of concatenated 
- formulas in the vignette are now rendered correctly
- fixed a bug in VSEM help

Minor Changes:

- changed the ordering of the summary metrics of summary.mcmcSampler, and summary.mcmcSamplerList
- renamed marginalLikelihood output to "ln.ML"
- added tests for plotTimeSeriesResults, marginalPlot and marginalLikelihood
- added an example with restart to DEzs


# BayesianTools 0.1.3

Compatibility

- created compatibility to new Rcpp standard

Changes

- getSample extended to coda objects, so that all plot functions can also be used on coda objects 
- plotTimeSeriesResults now includes the option to create residual plots from posterior predictive simulations, calling the DHARMa package
- added new utitility functions sampleEquallySpaced and correctThin

Bugfixes

- IMPORTANT: fixed a bug in createPriorDensity - results with createPriorDensity prior to this bugfix may be unrealiable
- getSample now corrects wrong inputs for thin and numSamples instead of throwing an error
- smaller bugfixes in plot functions
