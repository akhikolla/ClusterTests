## Bayesian analysis of multivariate generalized linear models via copulas

This package contains two main functions. 
  * `bayescopulaglm` samples from the posterior of a multivariate generalized linear model (currently supported families are `poisson`, `gaussian`, `binomial`, and `gamma`.
  * `predict.bayescopulaglm` which samples from the predictive posterior density of a `bayescopulaglm` object.
